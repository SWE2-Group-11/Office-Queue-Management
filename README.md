| `cors` | Allows the frontend origin to call the API |
| `socket.io` | Real-time events between server and clients |
| `better-sqlite3` | SQLite database (synchronous driver) |
| `typescript` | Type checking and compilation (pinned to v6) |
| `tsx` | Runs TypeScript directly in development, with auto-restart |
| `oxlint` | Linting |
| `vitest` | Test runner |
| `supertest` | HTTP API integration tests |
| `socket.io-client` | Testing socket events |
| `@types/*` | Type definitions for Node, Express, cors, better-sqlite3 and supertest |

### Getting started

Requires Node 22 or newer.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

If running for the first time or in need to recreate the database:
